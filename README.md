# 3D_Lightning_stroke

This is an attept to make a 3D Lightning stroke simulation.

Based upon:
 **[Mathematical Model of Lightning Stroke Development](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224347603_Mathematical_Model_of_Lightning_Stroke_Development)** by Slavko Vujevic
 
Plotly express was used in visualization. However one can use whatever they prefer.

[Right now this is only half baked, there is still a lot to do. Will work on it in my free time, hopefully.]
